## Own word explanations of different concept

### Ingress
An entity that provides and controls external access to services running inside kubernetes cluster (they are usually not connected to the Internet).

As mentioned in docs, it usually works with HTTP(S) connections.
Some of its functionality is:
* load balancing
* providing external access to services
* some ssl/tls related stuff
(and other fancy stuff I haven't used/needed yet)

For example, we may want to send requests to path `/aboba` to service `aboba-service` and `/popular-trendy-app` to more scaled `popular-service`.

### Ingress controller
Makes ingress work. There are different controllers available, such as Nginx, one for amazon, one for google cloud (probably yandex cloud one also exists somewhere :P).

### StatefulSet
Manages applications that have state.

Deployments (ReplicaSets) are designed for stateless applications. It means that no matter which of the pods in the set receives the request, the answer should be the same. Also on pod restart no info is usually saved (for example, metric counters in our apps should be erased). Any state that they might have is separated from the pods and is located on a single shared volume (apparently called "PersistentVolumeClaim") and all pods access it to get or put some info.

However, StatefulSet associates a persistent data volume with each pod (thus pods also are distinguished between each other by some ID), that is saved when the pod is restarted or updated. Also, it seems that it can be used when we need ordered update/deployment/scaling (maybe we for some reason may need to update pod 1 first?).

An example I could think of is running distributed system nodes (nod k8s nodes, rather smth like blockchain clients). The state is far easier to save between restarts in order to not synchronize from the very beginning each time (for example, it may require expensive computations like preparing cache for validating new transactions/blocks/other stuff). Also since it's originally a distributed system, each node already works with local state, which is exactly what happens here.

### DaemonSet
Seems similar to a stateful set. Runs a copy of specified pod on each node in the cluster. In the StatefulSet we control how many copies/pods do we have, which are distributed on pods optimally on the nodes according to kubernetes. It is needed when only one pod is needed for each node. Such pods may include some administrative programs (like clientful infrastructure management (Chef, according to quick google)) or monitoring tools for checking metrics for the (virtual) machine itself.

### PersistentVolumes
Volume/storage resource whose lifetime exceedes lifetime of a pod (because persistent). Can be different.

Not sure if it makes sense to go more in detail, volumes seem pretty clear.
