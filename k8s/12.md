# K8s ConfigMaps

In `config.json` I put some output I got when doing other course HW.

It contains secret scan report, which becomes accessible inside the started pod:

```bash
$ helm secrets install time-web-app-python time-web-app-python/ -f ./time-web-app-python/secrets.yaml
NAME: time-web-app-python
LAST DEPLOYED: Wed Nov 16 19:10:23 2022
NAMESPACE: default
STATUS: deployed
REVISION: 1
NOTES:
1. Get the application URL by running these commands:
     NOTE: It may take a few minutes for the LoadBalancer IP to be available.
           You can watch the status of by running 'kubectl get --namespace default svc -w time-web-app-python'
  export SERVICE_IP=$(kubectl get svc --namespace default time-web-app-python --template "{{ range (index .status.loadBalancer.ingress 0) }}{{.}}{{ end }}")
  echo http://$SERVICE_IP:80
removed './time-web-app-python/secrets.yaml.dec'

## Bonus

### StatefulSet

Manages applications that have state.

Deployments (ReplicaSets) are designed for stateless applications. It means that no matter which of the pods in the set receives the request, the answer should be the same. Also on pod restart no info is usually saved (for example, metric counters in our apps should be erased). Any state that they might have is separated from the pods and is located on a single shared volume (apparently called "PersistentVolumeClaim") and all pods access it to get or put some info.

However, StatefulSet associates a persistent data volume with each pod (thus pods also are distinguished between each other by some ID), that is saved when the pod is restarted or updated. Also, it seems that it can be used when we need ordered update/deployment/scaling (maybe we for some reason may need to update pod 1 first?).

An example I could think of is running distributed system nodes (not k8s nodes, rather smth like blockchain clients). The state is far easier to save between restarts in order to not synchronize from the very beginning each time (for example, it may require expensive computations like preparing cache for validating new transactions/blocks/other stuff). Also since it's originally a distributed system, each node already works with local state, which is exactly what happens here.

### Headless Services

With `clusterIP` the service is handled by kube-proxy, which means it does stuff like load balancing, service discovery. Headless servers allow to disable this and probably use some other solution instead.

One application may be is when the features are not needed and we just disable this stuff. Another example is lack of some features in kubernetes provided implementation. We may want to use some other solution, which of course requires turning off existing one.

### PersistentVolumes

Volume/storage resource whose lifetime exceedes lifetime of a pod (because persistent). Can be different. Can have different access modes, sizes, access policies.

Needed when we want to save state between pods change/removal. Maybe it is some cache that takes long to recompute.
