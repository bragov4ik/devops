After this `terraform show` shows port 8080 as expected and opening `localhost:8080` in browser also does the job.

```bash
...
    ports {
        external = 8080
        internal = 80
        ip       = "0.0.0.0"
...
```

### Outputs

```bash
$ terraform output
container_id = "e1d382129523f1556a53e0bee61611af9f99458cafc562f4bd3f754214b391fa"

```

## Yandex cloud

Since AWS/Google is not available and I couldn't get GitHub student pack :( (so no Azure either).

Also, since there is no simple tutorial for Yandex Cloud, I've done approximately similar steps to the other ones.

### Build infrastructure

To start I've created terraform manifest that creates VM instance in Yandex Cloud (authenticating via service account created beforehand). Also it outputs external IP of the VM so that I can connect and check if it's working.

`terraform show`

```bash
# yandex_compute_instance.some_resource_1:

### Change infrastructure

I was applying updates when trying to enable public IPs.

Here is the output of this process:

```bash
$ terraform apply
yandex_vpc_network.foo: Refreshing state... [id=enpnk8409dj4hdo58buo]
yandex_vpc_subnet.foo: Refreshing state... [id=e9besfa1ij06o6ei2k4m]
yandex_compute_instance.some_resource_1: Refreshing state... [id=fhmqb13hp4kdagr4cq47]

Terraform used the selected providers to generate the following execution plan. Resource actions are indicated with the following symbols:
  ~ update in-place

Terraform will perform the following actions:

  # yandex_compute_instance.some_resource_1 will be updated in-place
  ~ resource "yandex_compute_instance" "some_resource_1" {
        id                        = "fhmqb13hp4kdagr4cq47"
        name                      = "test"
        # (9 unchanged attributes hidden)

      ~ network_interface {
          ~ nat                = false -> true
            # (7 unchanged attributes hidden)
        }

        # (4 unchanged blocks hidden)
    }

Plan: 0 to add, 1 to change, 0 to destroy.

Do you want to perform these actions?
  Terraform will perform the actions described above.
  Only 'yes' will be accepted to approve.

  Enter a value: yes

yandex_compute_instance.some_resource_1: Modifying... [id=fhmqb13hp4kdagr4cq47]
yandex_compute_instance.some_resource_1: Still modifying... [id=fhmqb13hp4kdagr4cq47, 10s elapsed]
yandex_compute_instance.some_resource_1: Modifications complete after 16s [id=fhmqb13hp4kdagr4cq47]

Apply complete! Resources: 0 added, 1 changed, 0 destroyed.
```

### Input variables

I used variables to specify instance name. It works successfully

```bash
$ terraform apply -var "instance_name=yet-another-name"
yandex_vpc_network.foo: Refreshing state... [id=enpnk8409dj4hdo58buo]
yandex_vpc_subnet.foo: Refreshing state... [id=e9besfa1ij06o6ei2k4m]
yandex_compute_instance.some_resource_1: Refreshing state... [id=fhmqb13hp4kdagr4cq47]

Terraform used the selected providers to generate the following execution plan. Resource actions are indicated with the following symbols:
  ~ update in-place

Terraform will perform the following actions:

  # yandex_compute_instance.some_resource_1 will be updated in-place
  ~ resource "yandex_compute_instance" "some_resource_1" {
        id                        = "fhmqb13hp4kdagr4cq47"
      ~ name                      = "ttest" -> "yet-another-name"
        # (9 unchanged attributes hidden)

        # (5 unchanged blocks hidden)
    }

Plan: 0 to add, 1 to change, 0 to destroy.

Do you want to perform these actions?

yandex_compute_instance.some_resource_1: Modifying... [id=fhmqb13hp4kdagr4cq47]
yandex_compute_instance.some_resource_1: Modifications complete after 6s [id=fhmqb13hp4kdagr4cq47]

Apply complete! Resources: 0 added, 1 changed, 0 destroyed.

Outputs:

external_ip = "84.201.135.76"
```

### Outputs

As I mentioned before, I used outputs to show public IP of the instance

```bash
$ terraform output
external_ip = "84.201.135.76"
```

## Best terraform practices

* Use .gitignore for terraform
* Keep token as environmental variable (instead of Terraform variable/file/hardcode into config)
* Organize terraform files into folders
* Destroying running instances after finishing the tasks
* Used TFLint with default rules for terraform files
* Not repeating resource type in names
* Start every module with a main.tf file, where resources are located by default.
* In every module, include a README.md file in Markdown format. In the README.md file, include basic documentation about the module.
* Using naming conventions for configuration objects
* Declare all variables in `variables.tf`
* Give variables defined types
* When appropriate, provide default values
