# Moscow time zone web application

This application launches a web server that runs on port 8000 and responds with current time in UTC/GMT +3 timezone.

## Python implementation

You can find implementation written in Python language in folder `app_python`. Also there is `PYTHON.md` file in the directory that lists some best practices used in the project and reasoning behind framework choice.

This application can be set up/run manually or as a docker container

### Docker run guide

#### With `docker compose`

If you have docker compose installed, you can just write `docker compose up` inside project folder.

#### Without `docker compose`

Without `compose` you can use `docker run -p 8000:8000 --rm bragov4ik/time_web_app:latest`.
*Note that building the image by yourself requires docker buildkit enabled*

### Manual run

#### Preparation (set up)

* Open project folder
* Create virtual environment with `python3 -m venv venv`
* Activate the venv with `. venv/bin/activate`
* Install requirements with `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`

#### Run

Start the server with `gunicorn app:app -b 0.0.0.0:8000`

### Unit tests

To test you first need to install requirements for test environment `pip3 install -r requirements/test.txt`

With `pytest` and other requirements installed you simply need to type `pytest` inside python project folder.

### Docker hub integration

To publish a new version to docker hub create a tag corresponding to the (semver) version of expected image. For example `v1.2.3`.

When the tag appears in the repo, workflow will build the image and push it to docker hub.

## Rust ü¶Ä memory-safe üõ°Ô∏è blazing fast üöÄ implementation

Rust implementation together with corresponding `RUST.md` is located in `app_rust` folder.

This application can be set up/run manually or as a docker container.

### Configuration

You can update webserver configuration in `Rocket.toml` file. Documentation on the config can be found [here](https://rocket.rs/v0.5-rc/guide/configuration/).

### Docker run guide

#### With `docker compose`

If you have docker compose installed, you can just write `docker compose up` inside project folder.

#### Without `docker compose`

Without `compose` you can use `docker run -p 8000:8000 --rm bragov4ik/time_rust_web_app:latest`.
*Note that building the image by yourself requires docker buildkit enabled*

### Manual run

To run use `cargo run`

## Usage

When any of the servers is up and running, you can open [localhost:8000](localhost:8000) and you should see current Moscow time.
