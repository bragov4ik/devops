# Moscow time zone web application

This application launches a web server that runs on port 8000 and responds with current time in Moscow timezone.

## Python implementation

You can find implementation written in Python language in folder `app_python`. Also there is `PYTHON.md` file in the directory that lists some best practices used in the project and reasoning behind framework choice.

This application can be set up/run manually or as a docker container

### Docker run guide

* Run `docker build .`

#### Run

To run the image you can use `sudo docker run -p 8000:8000 --rm <image ID>`.

### Manual run

#### Preparation (set up)

* Open project folder
* Create virtual environment with `python3 -m venv venv`
* Activate the venv with `. venv/bin/activate`
* Install requirements with `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`

#### Run

Start the server with `gunicorn app:app -b 0.0.0.0:8000`

## Rust ü¶Ä memory-safe üõ°Ô∏è blazing fast üöÄ implementation

This application can be set up/run manually or as a docker container.

### Docker run guide

If you have docker compose installed, you can just write `docker compose up`. Otherwise, do it as follows:
